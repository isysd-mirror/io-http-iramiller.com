# Fintech Event Series

Starting next Wednesday May 17th, I will host a weekly [PanaFintech](http://www.panafintech.com/) event. This event series focuses on technology, whereas the monthly PanaFintech events are more about business, networking, and awareness.

+ [week 1](images/guld-weekly-event-1.jpg) [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/panamajs/events/239824122/)

Whenever possible, these events will be a concerted effort with other technical groups like, [Panama Bitcoin meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Panama-Bitcoin/), and [PanamaJS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/panamajs/).

Though I or some other PanaFintech community member will be prepared to present a topic each week, coordination and cross promotion are very important. We're open to suggestions to change agenda, location, or time of any week's event.

### When

Every Wed. at 7pm unless otherwise specified.

### Where

Restaurante El Charro Mexicano
Calle 74
San Francisco, Panama City, Panama

### Format

| Begin time | End time | Agenda |
|-------|-----|--------|
| 7:00 | 7:15 | Intro (w/ language vote) |
| 7:15 | 7:45 | Presentation(s) |
| 8:00 | 9:00 | Networking |

If Ira or another sufficiently bilingual person is presenting, the Intro will include a show of hands vote on the presentation language. The intro and presentation will be webcast to [PanaFintech on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClQwyXlPD-Ypirp9nVxO_bg/live), unless the presenter opts out.

Launch events will have different location and format.

### Organization

For now coordination for future events should be done through [PanaFintech slack](https://panafintech.slack.com) and published to [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=panafintech%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Panama).
